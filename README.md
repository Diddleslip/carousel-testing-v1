# Carousel Testing Solo Project
### A repo devoted to testing out many carousel NPMs.

### Things learned:
* Tested over 5 NPM's and looked over various others, only two had the functionality needed and only one was able to work correctly.
* Became efficient in searching for the right material after looking over dozens of Docs, Articles, and Youtube videos for this project.
* Many NPM's have very basic Carousels which hinder your project if you're looking for sophistication. 

### Overall, a productive project which allowed for better understanding of Carousel Components.

## KEY NOTES:
* The first Carousel was made with Bootstrap NPM 
* The second Carousel was made with Alice-Carousel NPM in a `Class` Component 
* The third Carousel was made with Alice-Carousel NPM in a `Function` Component 

*  If you're looking at my work make sure to look at the ThirdCarsousel.js file, as that is the final and polished version.
